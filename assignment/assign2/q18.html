        <h1>18.What is SVG?</h1>
        <p>SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a markup language used for describing two-dimensional vector graphics, which are images created with lines, curves, and shapes that are defined mathematically, rather than using pixels like raster graphics. SVG is an XML-based format, which means it uses markup tags to define graphics elements, and it can be rendered directly by web browsers or other software that supports SVG.</p>
